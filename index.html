						The League Champion Select Helper was designed to allow solo queue players to optimize their potential picks, and to learn by example how to pick to different situations. Disclaimer: This program will recommend champions that you may not play (or even own, though this is slotted to be changed - See <i> Upcoming Changes </i> for more info) and as such works best when used by a "Jack of All Trades" player because it will recommend whatever fits the situation best.
						<br>
						All this is to say that you should use this program once you're at least familiar with all champions, and are willing to try out new things. Also, do not rely solely on this feedback, use your own judgement and intuition. This just provides a statistical summary of the situation to base your choice on.
