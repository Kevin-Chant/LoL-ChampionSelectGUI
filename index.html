						The League Champion Select Helper was designed to allow solo queue players to optimize their potential picks, and to learn by example how to pick to different situations. Disclaimer: This program will recommend champions that you may not play (or even own, though this is slotted to be changed - See <i> Upcoming Changes </i> for more info) and as such works best when used by a "Jack of All Trades" player because it will recommend whatever fits the situation best.
						<br>
						All this is to say that you should use this program once you're at least familiar with every champion, and are willing to try out new things. Also, do not rely solely on this feedback, use your own judgement and intuition. This just provides a statistical summary of the situation to base your choice on.

						First, you will be asked to input some basic data such as Summoner Name, Region, and what team you are on (you can see this by which team has the first ban, as well as the color of the text "Your Team" above the first pick). Currently, what role you will be playing is included in this stage but will be modified and possibly moved to match next season's champion select.

						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						Then, you will need to select all the bans and picks as they happen up until it is your turn. The currently banning team, or currently picking player will be highlighted. One note for this phase is that blue team is statically on the left side of this GUI, and red team is on the right, while in the client if you are on red side, you will be on the left. The search bar functions the same as it does in the client. Simply click on a champion's icon to ban/pick (there is no lock in function yet, I'm debating between this and an undo button. For now, if you make a mistake you have to restart the program).

						Since the chat box is empty (like much of the GUI it's simply there to aesthetically mirror the client), it is instead used for two buttons: the first is for if one team captain misses a ban, and the second is used to tell the program there are no further picks. You should click this once you've inputted everyone's pick and it is your turn to select a champion.
